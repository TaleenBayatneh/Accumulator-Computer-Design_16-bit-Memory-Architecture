# Accumulator Computer Design - 16-bit Memory Architecture
 Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a 16-bit accumulator-based computer using Verilog HDL. The system follows Von Neumann architecture principles with a focus on the accumulator register as the central component for arithmetic and logical operations.
